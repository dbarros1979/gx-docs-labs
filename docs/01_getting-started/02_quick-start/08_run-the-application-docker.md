## Create a new Schema

Before you can run your application, you need to create a new schema for the database, where all the tables will be created (in our case, there is only one). To do that, follow these two steps:

1. Run `genesis-install`.

![Genesis Install](/img/intellij-genesisInstall.png)

2. Run `remap`.

## Send data to Genesis
Now that you have your database up and running, you need to send the login information so that you can access the application you have just created. To do this, go to **server/jvm/alpha-site-specific/src/main/resources/data/user.csv**:

![](/img/import_csv_to_genesis.png)

You will be prompted with the following message: 

```powershell
WARNING: Are you sure you want to import all the tables from all the csv files to the database? (y/n)
```
Type **y** to proceed.

After that, you have all the data to start the application.

  <summary>Want to check if your data has been sent?</summary>
  To check your database, the Genesis Intellij plugin has the following script: 

  ![](/img/DbMon-script.png)

  Type `table USER` and press **Enter**. Then type `search 1` and press **Enter**. This displays:
  

```bash

## Starting the server
:::note
Make sure you have started the [resource deamon](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#remap).
:::
Once your resource deamon has started, you can start all Genesis processes; click on the **start** button.

![](/img/genesis_deamon.png)

Wait for all processes to be healthy (it may take a few minutes for the first run).

## Accessing the application

Now you are ready to run the application you have created for the front end.

Using the Genesis IntelliJ plugin click the [Start UI button](../../../server/tooling/intellij-plugin/#starting-the-ui) on the toolbar as shown below. This builds your front-end codebase and starts the webpack webserver in development mode.

![Debug Window](/img/intellij-ui.png)

The application will open at `http://localhost:6060/login`.

## Conclusion
Thatâ€™s it. You have quickly built a very simple application using some fundamental Genesis components. You can see a grid of trades. Try adding a new one.

There's obviously a lot more to building enterprise-ready applications. However, you now have enough knowledge and experience of the Genesis low-code platform to look at our reference documentation and learn more there.
