## Docs structure

It is important to follow the Docs structure (folders, files, etc.) otherwise you will encounter unexpected errors and be unable to contribute. Here is a list of tips before you get started:

- The `docs` is the next version of the documentation and will be published at the end of the current release.
- In `docs` folder, you can see that the individual markdown pages are stored according to the menus shown at the top of the `docs site` (**Learning**, **Database**, etc.). It is important to follow this structure.
